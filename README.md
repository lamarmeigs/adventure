# adventure

Conceived as an airplane project (a diversion during long, typically delayed airline travel) after playing Robin Johnson's [Hamlet: the Text Adventure](http://versificator.net/hamlet/) one too many times, this project is planned to be a text adventure framework built on python. It will provide a series of classes defining characters, locations, etc. as well as a command parser to allow a player to interact with the created world. Game files will be persisted as JSON files that the engine will read and write on demand.
